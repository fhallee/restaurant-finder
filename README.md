# Best Restaurant Finder

This script helps you find highly-rated restaurants near a specific location using the Google Maps Places API.

I created this script because I've noticed that some of the best dining experiences often come from restaurants with fewer than 200 reviews but consistently high ratings (usually above 4.6 stars). This script allows me to quickly identify these "hidden gems" in any city I'm visiting.

**Requirements**
- Python 3
- 'googlemaps' library
   ```bash
   pip install googlemaps
**Usage**
1. Get your Google Maps API key from https://console.cloud.google.com/ and save it as an environment variable.
    ```bash
    export GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
2. Choose coordinates and a radius for the location you're interested in. You can use a tool like [Map Developers](https://www.mapdevelopers.com/draw-circle-tool.php).
3.
